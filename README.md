# try-cb-frontend-v2

이 코드는 https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-frontend-v2 에서 가지고 온 것입니다.

This is a sample application for getting started with Couchbase Server and our SDKs.
The application runs a single page web UI for demonstrating SQL for Documents (N1QL), Sub-document requests and Full Text Search (FTS) querying capabilities. y
It uses Couchbase Server together with a server backend using one of our SDKs, and Vue and Bootstrap on the front end.

The application is a flight planner that allows the user to search for and select a flight route (including the return flight) based on airports and dates.
Airport selection is done dynamically using an autocomplete box bound to N1QL queries on the server side. After selecting a date, it then searches for applicable air flight routes from a previously populated database. An additional page allows users to search for Hotels using less structured keywords.

## How to run

### Quickstart: via backend

We recommend starting by checking out of one of the backends:
each backend has a Docker script and full instructions to build the backend code, couchbase database, and the frontend.

The following backends are currently available, we intend to provide one for each SDK:

 * [Python](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-python/)
 * [Node.js](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-nodejs/)
 * [Java](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-java)
 * [Scala](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-scala)
 * [PHP](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php/)
 * [.Net](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-dotnet/)

 ### Build with docker

Alternatively, if you're interested in modifying the frontend code, with
[Docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed, simply.

    docker-compose up
    # now open http://localhost:8081/

NOTE: this will run the Python backend.

### Update the frontend code

After modifying the frontend code, you could rebuild it in docker with:

    docker-compose build frontend

This process is rather heavyweight, so you may prefer to run the frontend separately with node, as follows.

### Running the front-end manually

    # Build dependencies
    npm install

    # Run just the backend and database in one terminal
    docker-compose up backend db

    # Run the frontend server locally. This will auto-restart when you modify the code.
    npm run serve
